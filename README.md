# PythonPals

## Usage
`This project is a game intended to teach new programmers basic concepts of the Python language in an
engaging, 2D battle. Players will choose which concepts they would like to review (e.g. syntax, logic,
number conversion) and then enter a battle scene where they will be asked multiple-choice questions and
be expected to provide the correct answer. A correct answer deals damage to the opponent while an
incorrect answer reduces the player's own HP. The player wins when their opponent's HP reaches zero and
the player loses if their own HP reaches zero. While the initial project will have preset questions
relating to Python, we will be adding functionality allowing users to create their own question decks
for use in a variety of fields.

`**Note: In this version PythonPals, there are two bugs. One, to avoid glitching with the battle scene display, do not resize the game window unless in the main menu screen. For the questions menu on the battle scene, some of the longer questions have been cut off instead of continuing to the next line. For now, the readability of the majority of questions was prioritized over displaying the entirety of the longer ones.`
